# ISMT - Estruturas de Datas e Algoritmos

The 2023-2024 Data Structures and Algorithms course at Instituto Superior Miguel Torga, where I am an international student during the fall semester

## Description

The programming language used for the course is Java, and here will be found all of the .java files (and others) written during the class and for assignments.

### Executing a program

Every one of the files can be compiled using

And then run with
